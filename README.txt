Currently we just have it set up so you can see how to move through everything.

The ViewControllers are all the same as they are in the MVC

NOTE: When you open, make sure you open the HealthApp.xcworkspace project and
not the HealthAp.xcodeproj one. This accounts for the FireBase stuff (We
haven't set it up yet but that's how it works)
